## Exclusive tip:

I use this application in connection with [Smart Book reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kursx.smartbook). I’m not developer of it, but I very love it.

This app allow me to read books in foreign language.

And if I see word which I dont know, then I touch it, app shows me translation, I click \`add to dictionary\` and continue reading.

And after few days (and bunch of new words) I open my dictionary there, press \`export\` -> \`Export to Memorize\`, then paste those text in this app.

And in moments of procrastination just open this app and practise my vocabulary.`;
